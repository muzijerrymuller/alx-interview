When completing a task like this, one would gain practical experience and demonstrate proficiency in several key technical areas:

Key Learning Outcomes:
API Interaction and Data Handling:

Understanding RESTful APIs: Learn to query APIs (in this case, the Star Wars API) using the appropriate HTTP methods (GET) to fetch data.
Data Parsing and Processing: Extract and process nested JSON data from API responses to obtain relevant information (e.g., the characters array).
Asynchronous Programming:

Handling Asynchronous Operations: Use asynchronous programming constructs like Promises or async/await to manage API calls and ensure data is fetched in the correct order.
Dependency Management:

Using External Libraries: Gain experience with request (or its alternatives) for making HTTP requests, understanding how to install and utilize third-party modules in a Node.js environment.
Problem Solving and Algorithmic Thinking:

Efficient Iteration: Loop through an array of character URLs, retrieve their data sequentially or concurrently, and maintain the order for proper output.
Edge Case Handling: Handle scenarios like invalid movie IDs, API downtime, or malformed responses gracefully.
Command-Line Interface (CLI) Scripting:

Input Handling: Learn to build scripts that accept positional arguments, enabling dynamic behavior based on user input.
Shell Integration: Write scripts that integrate seamlessly with the command-line environment, making them useful in DevOps or scripting tasks.
Software Engineering Best Practices:

Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling to provide meaningful feedback if the API request fails or the Movie ID is invalid.
Clean Code: Organize code for readability, using comments and modular functions.
Domain-Specific Knowledge:

Engagement with Popular APIs: Familiarity with APIs like the Star Wars API opens the door to working with similar APIs in other domains, such as finance, social media, or cloud services.
Portfolio and Real-World Problem Solving:

This task reflects real-world skills valuable in building automation tools, backend services, or data pipelines that interact with third-party APIs.
Completing such a task not only solidifies oneâ€™s technical skills in JavaScript and API handling but also demonstrates the ability to build practical, reusable tools for fetching and displaying data dynamically. These skills are directly applicable to software development, data engineering, and API integration roles.
