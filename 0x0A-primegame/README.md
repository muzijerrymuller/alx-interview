Prime Numbers and Algorithms:

Understanding how to identify prime numbers efficiently is central to this problem. This involves implementing or optimizing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to precompute prime numbers up to a given range (since n can be as large as 10,000).
You learn how to apply prime numbers in a game-theory context, where their removal also involves removing multiples.
Game Theory:

By simulating turns between Maria and Ben, you explore concepts of optimal strategies and winning conditions in combinatorial games.
This teaches you to think critically about state transitions, possible moves, and the end-game conditions.
Dynamic Programming and Precomputation:

Precomputing data like prime counts for each possible n can optimize the function for multiple game rounds. This reduces redundant calculations and improves efficiency.
You learn how to balance computational cost upfront versus runtime performance during query handling.
Handling Edge Cases:

Exploring cases like n = 1 (where no primes exist) ensures you think about boundary conditions and robust error handling.
These cases push you to design your solution to gracefully handle trivial and non-trivial inputs.
Efficient Input and Output Processing:

With constraints on x and n (up to 10,000), you learn to handle large inputs efficiently.
The importance of reducing runtime and space complexity becomes apparent.
Designing for Constraints:

No package imports mean that every part of the solution, from prime generation to gameplay simulation, must be implemented from scratch.
This reinforces core programming skills, such as writing algorithms without relying on libraries.
Logical Debugging:

Since the problem involves multiple interconnected parts (prime computation, game state management, and result calculation), debugging requires tracking logical flow meticulously.
This strengthens your debugging and reasoning skills.
Collaborative Code Design:

If working as part of a team, you must ensure the code is modular, readable, and testable, which teaches the value of good software practices.
Competitive Problem Solving:

Problems like this are common in coding interviews and competitions, so solving them helps you practice under similar constraints and pressure
