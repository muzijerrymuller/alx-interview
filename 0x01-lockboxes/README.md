here's what I’ve learned while solving the lockboxes problem:

1. Graph Theory in Action
One of the first things I realized is that this problem is essentially a graph traversal task. Each box acts like a node, and each key represents an edge leading to another node. Solving this reinforced my understanding of how to represent real-world problems as graphs. I also had to decide between Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), which deepened my grasp of these traversal techniques and their practical trade-offs.

2. Efficient State Tracking
To determine which boxes were accessible, I learned to use a set to track visited nodes. Sets made lookups efficient, ensuring I wasn’t revisiting already unlocked boxes, and helped optimize the algorithm's performance. This was a great exercise in balancing algorithmic complexity and memory usage.

3. Recursive vs. Iterative Approaches
Initially, I thought about implementing the solution recursively since it felt intuitive for a problem like this. But I quickly learned about Python’s recursion depth limits and the risk of stack overflow for larger inputs. Switching to an iterative approach taught me how to handle stack-based problems manually using a list structure for DFS.

4. Edge Case Management
This problem pushed me to think deeply about edge cases:

What if a box had no keys?
What if all keys were irrelevant to the existing boxes?
What if there were only one box or all boxes were accessible from the start? Testing and debugging these scenarios taught me how critical edge case analysis is in algorithm design. I also learned how small changes in logic could break the function for uncommon inputs.
5. Boolean Logic and Conditional Statements
The problem sharpened my ability to build logical conditions. For example, I had to figure out:

How to detect whether all boxes were unlocked.
When to stop the traversal early if all boxes were already visited. Balancing multiple conditions in a clean and readable way improved my code clarity and structure.
6. Understanding Dependencies
This exercise made me think about dependency resolution. Each box could depend on multiple keys, and solving the problem required me to carefully manage those dependencies to ensure I didn’t miss any connections. It felt like managing task dependencies in a scheduler, which gave me insights into real-world scenarios like build systems or task orchestration.

7. Python-Specific Practices
I got a chance to refine my Python skills:

Using sets for efficient membership testing.
Leveraging for loops for nested iterations in a clean, readable way.
Structuring functions to return early, which keeps logic straightforward and avoids unnecessary computation.
8. Building Robustness
This problem taught me how to ensure my code was robust enough to handle unpredictable input formats. For instance, some boxes contained keys that didn’t map to any existing box. Recognizing and gracefully handling these cases was a key takeaway.

9. Testing Methodologies
I realized the importance of testing with diverse inputs. I built test cases ranging from trivial (one box) to complex (many interconnected boxes with irrelevant keys). Writing these tests taught me to think critically about how users—or interviewers—might try to break my function.

10. Problem-Solving Confidence
Finally, solving this problem built my confidence. It’s one thing to read about graph theory or DFS in a textbook, but applying these concepts to a practical problem helped me see their utility. I came out of this with a deeper understanding of not just how algorithms work, but why they’re so powerful.

What It All Means
By solving the lockboxes problem, I didn’t just learn how to unlock boxes—I learned how to unlock the potential of algorithms, the efficiency of Python, and my ability to tackle complex, interdependent systems. This was a highly technical exercise, but one that sharpened my mindset and refined my approach to solving computational problems.
